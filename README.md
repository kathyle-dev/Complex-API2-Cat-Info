# Complex API: RANDOM CAT BREED INFORMATION GENERATOR
#### Project Scope: The user presses a button that displays name, temperament, description and article link of a random cat breed. Each time the user clicks the button, the program fetches the JSON response from two APIs: the Cat Fact Ninja API that generates the random breed which is then used in the catAPI fetch URL to get and display the rest of the information.
